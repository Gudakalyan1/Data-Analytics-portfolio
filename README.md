https://github.com/Gudakalyan1/Kalyan-G.Github.io./blob/main/KNN%20Pima%20indian%20diabetes.py
 
 In this project i build a machine learning model using k nearest neighbor algoritham to predict whether the patiens in pima indian dataset have dabetics or not
  the knn classifier with number of neighbors as 14 achieve the best score of 75%.
 
 # project:2
  # car safety 
   I built a decission tree classifier to predict the safety of the car.I build two models, one with criterion gini index and another one with criterion entropy. I implement       decision Tree Classification with Python and Scikit-Learn.
   The model yeilds a very good performance as indicated by the model accuracy in both cases which was found to be 89% on test data set.
   Gini index- train set=93%,test set=89%
   similarly the model criteration as entropy the train set accuracy is 93% and test accuracy 91%
